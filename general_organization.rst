Rooms
=====

All rooms require a video projector, sound amplification with a microphone for
the speaker and possibly power outlets along the desks to connect the laptops of
participants. The conference organizers install electric wiring in the rooms.

Tutorials
---------

The tutorials are held on days 1 and 2 in two rooms that can hold at least 120
people. The tutorials consist of two parallel tracks of two days, held in two
rooms, for the "beginner" and "advanced" tracks.

Main Conference track
---------------------

The main conference track takes place on days 3 and 4. The capacity of the room
should be of about 250 people.

It consists of a single track on the two days, each day beginning by a keynote
talk. Then, there is room for contributed talks and a poster session. The talks
are selected by the program committee and last 10, 20 or 30 minutes depending on
the interdisciplinary interest and technical details of the content.

Satellites meetings
-------------------

Satellite meetings are held the day following the main conference track. In
2011, satellite meetings have been held on Physics and Neuroscience. The
attendance is expected to be lower than for the other parts of the conference,
with 50-100 participants per meeting.

In 2012 and 2013, there were no satellite meetings.

Sprints
-------

Sprints are events allowing participants to collaborative projects to work in
the same physical location. The sprints require 3-4 rooms for 10 to 30 people
for collaborative work around tables, with video projector and amplification and
possibly power outlets along the desks to connect laptops. Sprints begin on day
5, right after the scientific track.

In 2013, there are sprints on: Python visualization (org: Nicolas P. Rougier),
Sage: Open Source Mathematics Software (org: Paul Zimmerman), NumPy and SciPy
(org: Ralf Gommers). The sprints are held in rooms K.3.201, K.3.401 and K.3.601.

Catering
========

During the conference, lunches and coffee breaks are provided. In 2012 and 2013,
the caterer "Gourmand Gaillard" provided the catering.

Registration
============

In the past, registration was taken care of by Logilab who managed the
http://www.euroscipy.org/ website, including an online payment system. In 2013,
a new website running on the pinax symposion platform has been developped and an
online payment system has been setup (using Plata with the ogone payment module).

Program management
==================

The program is managed, for the tutorials, main track and satellites, by their
respective program chairs. The program for the satellites is left fully to
satelitte organizers.

Sponsoring
==========

The overall budget for EuroSciPy is reasonable for an event of this
size. However, sponsoring is essential to ensure that good conditions are
provided to the participants.

Sponsoring takes place in different manners according to the sponsors.

Public sponsors
---------------

Applications for financial support have been awarded from the university, the
"Fonds de la Recherche Scienfique - FNRS" (Belgium) and "Visit Brussels", the
communications agency for tourism in the Brussels-Capital Region.

Private partners
----------------

The EuroSciPy conference has benefited of active support by several
private companies that helped in the organization and logistics of the
conference. These collaborations played a key role in the good planning of the
conference. These companies are Enthought Europe (Cambridge, UK), Logilab
(Paris, France) and Python Academy (Leipzig, Germany).

Since 2013, the German Neuroinformatics Node provides hosting for the website of
the conference.

Private sponsors
----------------

EuroSciPy has benefited from the support of private sponsors in the
past. Several sponsors have repied positively for 2013, they are listed in a
separate section.
