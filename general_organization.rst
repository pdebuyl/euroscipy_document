Rooms
=====

All rooms require

* A video projector.
* Sound amplification.
* Possibly power outlets along the desks to connect the laptops of participants.

Tutorials
---------

The tutorials are held on days 1 and 2 in two rooms that can hold more at least
120 people. The lectures require

The tutorials consist of two parallel tracks of two days, held in two rooms

* 1 room for the "beginner" track.
* 1 room for the "advanced" track.

Main Conference track
---------------------

The main conference track takes place on days 3 and 4. The capacity of the room
should be of more about 250 people.

It consists of a single track on the two days, each day beginning by a keynote
talk. Then, there is room for contributed talks and a poster session. The talks
are selected by the program committee and last 30 minutes.

Satellites meetings
-------------------

Satellite meetings are held the day following the main conference track. In
2011, satellite meetings have been held on Physics and Neuroscience. The
attendance is expected to be lower than for the other parts of the conference,
with 50-100 participants per meeting.

In 2012 and 2013, there were no satellite meetings.

Sprints
-------

Sprints are events allowing participants to collaborative projects to work in
the same physical location. The sprints require 3-4 rooms for 10 to 30 people
for collaborative work around tables, with video projector and amplification and
possibly power outlets along the desks to connect laptops. Sprints begin on day
5, right after the scientific track.

In 2013, there were sprints on: Python visualization (org: Nicolas P. Rougier),
Sage: Open Source Mathematics Software (org: Paul Zimmerman), NumPy and SciPy
(org: Ralf Gommers).

Catering
========

During the conference, lunches and coffee breaks are provided.

Lunch
-----

For lunch, we plan a buffet with "mange-debout" tables.

Coffee breaks
-------------

Coffee breaks are provided: one in the morning and one in the afternoon.

Registration
============

The user registration organization is ongoing work. In the past, this was taken
care of by Logilab who managed the http://www.euroscipy.org/ website, including
an online payment system.

Program management
==================

The program is managed, for the tutorials, main track and satellites, by their
respective program chairs. The program for the satellites is left fully to
satelitte organizers.

Sponsoring
==========

The overall budget for EuroSciPy is reasonable for an event of this
size. However, sponsoring is essential to ensure that good conditions are
provided to the participants.

Sponsoring takes place in different manners according to the sponsors.

Public sponsors
---------------

Applications have been filed within the university, to the "Fonds de la
Recherche Scienfique - FNRS" (Belgium) and "Visit Brussels", a local bureau of
tourism.

Private partners
----------------

The EuroSciPy conference has benefited in the past of active support by several
private companies that helped in the organization and logistics of the
conference. These collaborations played a key role in the good planning of the
conference. These companies are Enthought Europe (Cambridge, UK), Logilab
(Paris, France) and Python Academy (Leipzig, Germany).

These partnerships are likely to be renewed for the 2013 edition of the
conference.

Private sponsors
----------------

EuroSciPy has benefited from the support of private sponsors in the
past. Contact with sponsors for 2013 is in progress.
