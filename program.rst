==================
Scientific Program
==================

The two days of the scientific track of the conference start by a keynote
talk that provide a vision and/or a report status on issues of general interest
to the Scientific Python community. The rest of the day is devoted to
contributed talks that present the state-of-the-art in many fields of scientific
computing with Python.

The tutorials play an important role in the EuroSciPy conference and allow
beginner or advanced users of the Scientific Python tools to learn from
recognized experts. The first two days of the conference are devoted to the
tutorials that are held in two parallel tracks.

Abstract: Network ready research: The role of open source and open thinking
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The highest principle of network architecture design is interoperability. If
Metcalfe's Law tells us that a network's value can scale as some exponent of the
number of connections then our job in building networks is to ensure that those
connections are as numerous, as operational, and as easy to create as
possible. Where we make it easy for anyone to wire in new connections we
maximise the ability of others to contribute to the value of our shared
networks.

Amongst those using Python for research are a wide range different disciplines
and targets but one area that stands out for me, and stretches across a range of
traditional domains is the study of networks. Networks of physical interactions
and social networks, of genetic control or of ecological interactions amongst
many others. The scientific Python community is also amongst the most networked
of research communities and amongst the most open in the sharing of research
papers, of research data, tools, and even research in process in online
conversations and writing.

Lifting our gaze from the networks we work on to the networks we occupy is a
challenge. Our human networks are messy and contingent and our machine networks
clogged with things we can't use, even if we could access them. What principles
can we apply so as to build our research into networks that make the most of the
network infrastructure we have around us. Where are the pitfalls? And what are
the opportunities? What will it take to configure our work so as to enable
"network ready research"?

developing applications professionally using Python since 2001. Before
co-founding Continuum Analytics in 2011, Peter spent seven years at Enthought
designing and developing applications for a variety of companies, including
investment bankers, high-frequency trading firms, oil companies, and others. In
2007, Peter was named Director of Technical Architecture and served as client

Abstract: Python and the Future of Data Analysis: A Fugue in Three Parts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While Python has been a popular and powerful language for scientific computing
for a while now, its future in the broader data analytics realm is less clear,
especially as market forces and technological innovation are rapidly
transforming the field.

In this talk, Peter will introduce some new perspectives on "Big Data" and the
evolution of programming languages, and present his thesis that Python has a
central role to play in the future of not just scientific computing, but in
analytics and even computing in general. As part of the discussion, many new
libraries, tools, and technologies will be discussed (both Python and
non-Python), both to understand why they exist and where they are driving
technical evolution.

The goal is not to merely provide the audience with a new narrative about Python
and data analytics. Rather, hopefully everyone will feel motivated to be
proactive in evolving the language ecosystem and nurturing its adoption, in ways
that will best ensure its long-term relevance and improve the field of
computational analytics.

Tutorial sessions
=================

The tutorials are held in two tracks: beginner and advanced. The purpose of the
beginner track is to introduce scientists to the general scientific tools that
are available in Python so that the participants can start right away to work on
their own problems. The speakers in the advanced track are established experts
on the tools they cover. The tools covered are aimed at current users of Python
who wish to learn powerful tools that are either related to a given field
(statistics, for instance) or that are related to general scientific computing
skills (performance optimization, for instance).

Contributed talks, posters and lightning talks
==============================================

As it is customary in many computing conferences, an oral session is devoted to
lightning talks: participants register on site to present results, solutions or
ideas in a short time. This session is very much appreciated because of the
original contributions it brings and because of its lively character.

An original contribution this year is a panel discussion proposal by Mike Müller
on the topic "Making Programmers" that gathered Emmanuelle Gouillart, Valentin
Haenel, Ian Ozsvald, Gaël Varoquaux and Nelle Varoquaux who shared their
experience on the education to programming in the scientific, academic and
high-school environments.
