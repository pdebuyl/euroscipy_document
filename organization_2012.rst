==========================
Organization plan for 2012
==========================

Rooms
=====

The availability of the Dupréel room has been checked. This room is already
booked for days 1,2,3 and 4.

Availability should be checked for rooms in the U building (Baudoux and
Henriot).

Tutorials
---------

The tutorials are held in 2 rooms for 100 to 120 people. The lectures require

* A video projector.
* Sound amplification.
* Possibly power outlets along the desks to connect the laptops of participants.

The tutorials consist of two parallel tracks of two days, held in two rooms

* 1 room for the "beginner" track.
* 1 room for the "advanced" track.

The tutorials are held on the following days

* Day 1: Thursday, 23rd Aug. 2012.
* Day 2: Friday, 24th Aug. 2012.

Main Conference track
---------------------

The main conference track requires one large conference room for 250 people,
with video projector and amplification and possibly power outlets along the
desks to connect laptops to many listeners.

* Day 3: Saturday, 25th Aug. 2012.
* Day 4: Sunday 26th Aug. 2012.

Satellites meetings
-------------------

Satellites meetings (physics, neuro, finance, education ...): requires 3-4 rooms
for 50 to 100 people for presentations, with video projector and amplification
and possibly power outlets along the desks to connect laptops.

The satellite meetings take place on the day following the main conference track.

* Day 5: Monday 27th Aug. 2012.

Sprints
-------

Sprints are events allowing participants to collaborative projects to work in
the same physical location. The sprints require 3-4 rooms for 10 to 30 people
for collaborative work around tables, with video projector and amplification and
possibly power outlets along the desks to connect laptops.

* Day 6: Tuesday 28th Aug. 2012.
* Day 7: Wednesday 29th Aug. 2012.

General considerations
----------------------

We appreciate that the premises (especially those in day 3 and J 4 J, the conference itself) are

* Comfortable
* Of quality (to be equal to what we had in Paris this year at ENS)
* Close to each other to allow the circulation
* Close to a space that can be used for the breaks on mid-morning and
  mid-afternoon and lunch / cold buffet lunch, and that this space is adequate to
  receive posters on billboards (20-40)

Catering
========

During the conference, lunches and coffee breaks are provided.

Lunch
-----

For lunch, we plan a buffet with "mange-debout" tables.

Coffee breaks
-------------

Coffee breaks will provide, as expected, coffee.

Registration
============

Registration of participants will be taken care of by Logilab. Logilab manages
the `http://www.euroscipy.org`_ website. A online payment system is available.
This system has already been used in 2011 and Nicolas Chauvat of Logilab agrees
to take care of it for 2012.

Program management
==================

The program is managed, for the tutorials, main track and satellites, by their
respective program chairs. The program for the satellites is left fully to
satelitte organizers.

Sponsoring
==========

The sponsoring for EuroSciPy has, in previous years, been very light because the
hosting institutions provided infrastructure for free. For 2012 however, it is
planned to ask sponsoring to private and public sponsors. The accounting will be
done by Professor Hugues Bersini's lab for sponsor money and transactions within
the ULB. This is a necessary condition to manage funding from possible Belgian
funding sources.
