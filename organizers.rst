==============================
 Organizers of the conference
==============================

The conference organization is split up into different committees responsible
for the different aspects of the conference. Many committee members have already
taken part in previous editions of EuroSciPy. New additions to the team include
the local organizers from Brussels.

Role of the committees
======================

The chairs of the conference coordinate the organization of the conference and
the action of the committees. In addition, there are a tutorial chair and a
program chair taking care of these two important parts of the conference.

The local organization committee takes care of the venue, of the catering and of
contacts with the host institution. Local organizers will also try to find
Belgian sponsors.

The tutorials form an important part of the conference and as such a dedicated
group is responsible for its organization. The tutorial chair takes care of
finding tutorial speakers and of managing the schedule of the tutorials.

The program committee has the hard task to select the speakers for the
scientific track of the conference. The number of submissions to participate to
the conference as a speaker is such that only about 50% of the applicants obtain
a time slot.

A general organizing committee supports various aspects of the conference
organization such as the website, sponsoring and communication.
