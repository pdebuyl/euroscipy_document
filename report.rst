Post conference report
======================

The present report reviews all aspects of the organization of
EuroSciPy 2012. The present chapter reviews, a posteriori, the course of the
conference. The subsequent chapters contain factual information on the
conference and more detailed information, for instance with respect to the
scientific program.

General organization
====================

We had about 230 participants registered to the conference, for either the
tutorials, the scientific conference or both. Participants arrived without
problems at the conference location and received badges and information on
site. The capacity of the rooms was sufficient but, as noted later on we might
need bigger rooms for the tutorials. Also, the space in front of the tutorial
rooms is not very large in front of rooms H.1301 and H.1302. Attendance was
important in both tutorial tracks. We had power supply issues (differential fuse
shutting down) that could be solved thanks to the ULB "infrastructures" staff.

The conference took place in a more comfortable room, the Dupréel. There is a
large hall to host the coffee breaks, lunches and the poster session. Also,
student staff from the university made the technical aspect (microphones and
computer display) run flawlessly.

Network access via either the conference-provided login to the campus network or
via eduroam worked on average. Network saturation caused issues, but with about
200 people it was expected.

In tandem with "Aperos Belgium Python", we organized a social event on friday
evening that went very well.


Post conference survey
======================

The organization team put an online survey for participants. The aim was to get
feedback on the conference and use it in the planning of next year. Full
analysis of the data has not yet been performed but some of the most general
aspects are summarized here in the following table. All number are in percent,
the total number of replies, as of september 26th, was 64. The total fall below
100% because the replies were not mandatory to each question.

+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+
|                    | Very Satisfied     | Satisfied          | Neutral            | Dissatisfied       | Very dissatisfied  |
+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+
| General Opinion    | 52                 | 39                 | 6                  | 0                  | 0                  |
+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+
| Tutorials          | 22                 | 63                 | 6                  | 2                  | 0                  |
+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+
| Conference         | 23                 | 29                 | 5                  | 2                  | 0                  |
+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+

We can already state with confidence that the conference was appreciated by the
participants. The survey allowed comments and we will investigate what people
would like to see improved.

Not everyone replied to the country of origin question, but from the 58 replies
we had participants from:

+--------------------+-------+
| Belgium            | 14    |
+--------------------+-------+
| France             | 11    |
+--------------------+-------+
| Germany            | 10    |
+--------------------+-------+
| Italy              | 1     |
+--------------------+-------+
| Netherlands        | 6     |
+--------------------+-------+
| Spain              | 3     |
+--------------------+-------+
| Sweden             | 2     |
+--------------------+-------+
| Switzerland        | 2     |
+--------------------+-------+
| United Kingdom     | 3     |
+--------------------+-------+

Within Europe, most participants came from outside of Belgium. We note that many
people come from France and Germany. Extrapolation from this data, for the
purpose of estimating the number of foreign participants, provides the following
estimate: 26% of the participants come from outside of Belgium, making a total
of about 170 foreign participants.

+--------------------+-------+
| Brazil             | 1     |
+--------------------+-------+
| Korea              | 1     |
+--------------------+-------+
| South-Africa       | 3     |
+--------------------+-------+
| United States      | 1     |
+--------------------+-------+

From those two tables, we can confirm the European scope of the conference. The
presence of outside-of-Europe participants is a very positive sign as the
world-wide SciPy conference is held in the United States and we might expect
that those people would go there instead of going to EuroSciPy.

Tutorials
=========

The tutorials form an important part of EuroSciPy. The post-conference survey
contains a short evaluation for each tutorial that will be provided to the
tutorial speakers. Depending on Python usage in academic institutions in Europe,
we might see an increase of participants to the tutorials.

The tutorial rooms were full and having more than 100 people with computers
causes the rooms to heat. It might be more appropriate to use larger rooms next
year.

Conference
==========

The conference track contains by the very nature of EuroSciPy a wide range of
topics, all presented with the scientific tools for Python in mind. To emphasize
the diversity of topics, let us mention the awardees of the best talk, best
poster and jury awards: Steven Moran for "A Python Library for
Historical-Comparative Linguistics", Fabian Pedregosa for "Memory profiler" and
Simon Ratcliffe for "Python and the MeerKAT Radio Telescope". We have here the
humanities, a technical issue of programming and a complex scientific setup for
physics.

The keynote talks were well received and the speakers on both days addressed
relevant issues for the Python community.

The poster session was combined with a beer session which allowed people to
discuss freely around the posters depending on their interests.
The lightning talks were vivid and much appreciated. They also allow to close
the conference on an informal note and form a nice combination with the awards.

Sprints
=======

Two projects replied to the call for sprint: scikit-learn and
scikits-image. About 20 people gathered on monday for the sprints. Feedback on
the sprints will be given by the sprints organizers shortly.

Sponsors
========

As arranged with the sponsors, a poster comprising all sponsor logos was
displayed during the whole conference. For all tracks, the organizers listed all
sponsors as part of the acknowledgements.

The support from the sponsors, public or private, came in different forms (see
:ref:`orga_sponsor_label`) and all of them combined helped to make EuroSciPy
2012 a success.
