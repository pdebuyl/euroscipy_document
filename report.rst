Post conference report
======================

The present report reviews all aspects of the organization of
EuroSciPy 2013. The present chapter reviews, a posteriori, the course of the
conference. The subsequent chapters contain factual information on the
conference and more detailed information, for instance with respect to the
scientific program.

General organization
====================

We had about XXX participants registered to the conference, for either the
tutorials, the scientific conference or both. Participants arrived without
problems at the conference location and received badges and information on
site. The capacity of the rooms was sufficient.

There have been power supply issues (lighting in room H.1301 that shut down, for
instance) that could be solved thanks to the ULB "infrastructures" staff. The
electrical wiring for the participants held much better than in 2012, due to a
better repartition of power sources.

The conference took place in a more comfortable room, the Dupréel. There is a
large hall to host the coffee breaks, lunches and the poster session. Also,
student staff from the university made the technical aspect (microphones and
computer display) run flawlessly.

Network access via either the conference-provided login to the campus network or
via eduroam worked well. A few network saturation occured, but the situation
with respect to 2012 has improved a lot and there was almost no complaint on the
matter.

In tandem with "Aperos Belgium Python", we organized a social event on thursday
evening that went very well. A sponsor offered a round of drinks for the
occasion.

Post-conference survey
======================

A survey has been proposed to the participants. It is too early to close it, its
contents will be evaluated within a few weeks.

Conference
==========

The conference track contains by the very nature of EuroSciPy a wide range of
topics, all presented with the scientific tools for Python in mind.

In 2013, as in 2012, there have been awards for the best poster, best talk and a
jury award that went to Philippe Gervais for "Memory profiling", Bill Little for
"Iris and Cartopy: open source Python libraries for weather and climate science"
and Nicolas Rougier for "Vispy, A Modern and Interactive Scientific
Visualization".

The keynote talks were well received and the speakers on both days addressed
relevant issues for the Python community.

The poster session was combined with a beer session which allowed people to
discuss freely around the posters depending on their interests.

Sprints
=======

Five projects held a sprint on the sunday following the conference: "Python
visualization", "Sage: Open Source Mathematics Software", "NumPy and SciPy",
"scikit-learn" and "scikit-image". Feedback on the sprints will be given by the
sprints organizers shortly.

Sponsors
========

As arranged with the sponsors, a poster comprising all sponsor logos was
displayed during the whole conference. The organizers also listed all sponsors as
part of the acknowledgements during the main conference track.

The support from the sponsors, public or private, came in different forms (see
:ref:`orga_sponsor_label`) and all of them combined helped to make EuroSciPy
2013 a success.

On line payments
================

The registration system for EuroSciPy 2013 has been built on top of Pinax
Symposion and the Plata e-commerce platform for Django. The collaboration of the
Université libre de Bruxelles' accounting departement on that matter has been
very appreciated and helpful.
